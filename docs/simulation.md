# Simulation Process

This document explains how AgentReviewHub simulates user interactions with websites.

## Overview

The simulation process is designed to mimic realistic human behavior when interacting with websites. Each simulation is guided by a unique persona with specific characteristics, preferences, and behaviors.

## Current Implementation

The current simulation uses Playwright, a browser automation library, to interact with websites. The process includes:

1. **Website Loading**: The system loads the target website and measures initial load time
2. **Navigation**: Based on persona interests, the system navigates through the website
3. **Search**: The system attempts to search for products relevant to the persona's interests
4. **Product Interaction**: The system interacts with product pages, including viewing details and images
5. **Cart Interaction**: For e-commerce sites, the system adds items to cart and begins checkout
6. **Form Interaction**: The system interacts with forms based on persona characteristics
7. **Accessibility Check**: The system evaluates basic accessibility features

## Behavioral Modeling

Each persona influences the simulation in several ways:

- **Navigation Patterns**: Technical proficiency affects how directly the persona navigates
- **Attention Span**: Patience level affects how long the persona spends on each page
- **Error Handling**: Technical proficiency affects how the persona responds to errors
- **Device Preferences**: Device preferences determine viewport size and interaction methods
- **Accessibility Needs**: Special needs influence how the persona interacts with the site

## Data Collection

During simulation, the system collects various metrics:

- **Page Load Times**: Time taken to load each page
- **Navigation Success**: Whether navigation attempts were successful
- **Search Success**: Whether search attempts yielded relevant results
- **Task Completion**: Whether the persona could complete common tasks
- **Error Encounters**: Any errors or issues encountered during the simulation
- **Behavioral Insights**: Patterns of interaction and engagement

## Planned Improvements

Our next major update will focus on enhancing the simulation functionality:

1. **Custom Browser Interaction Module**: Replacing Playwright with a more specialized solution for:
   - More nuanced interaction patterns
   - Better handling of dynamic content
   - Improved error recovery
   - More realistic timing and pacing

2. **Enhanced Behavioral Models**:
   - More sophisticated decision-making processes
   - Learning and adaptation during the session
   - Emotional responses to website experiences
   - More varied interaction patterns

3. **Expanded Interaction Types**:
   - Social media integration
   - Account creation and management
   - Multi-session interactions
   - Cross-device experiences

## Technical Details

The simulation is implemented in the `src/interaction/simulator.py` module. Key classes include:

- `WebsiteSimulator`: Main class that orchestrates the simulation process
- `BrowserContext`: Manages browser instances and sessions
- `InteractionStrategy`: Defines how personas interact with different website elements
- `DataCollector`: Collects and organizes simulation data

For developers looking to extend the simulation capabilities, the `InteractionStrategy` class is designed to be easily extended with new interaction patterns.
