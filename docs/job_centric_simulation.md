# Job-Centric Simulation System Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for enhancing our e-commerce website evaluation system with a job-centric approach to simulation. Instead of focusing solely on individual actions, the system will now simulate complete "jobs to be done" that represent realistic user goals and tasks.

## Core Concepts

### Jobs to Be Done

A "job to be done" represents a complete user goal when visiting an e-commerce website. Examples include:

- **Product Discovery**: Browsing the website to discover products of interest
- **Price Checking**: Searching for a specific product to check its price
- **Purchase Completion**: Adding a product to cart and completing the checkout process
- **Research & Comparison**: Researching multiple products to compare features and prices
- **Account Management**: Creating an account, managing profile, or checking order history

### Job Components

Each job consists of:

1. **Objective**: The overall goal the user wants to accomplish
2. **Success Criteria**: How to determine if the job was completed successfully
3. **Task Sequence**: A series of high-level tasks that make up the job
4. **Decision Points**: Places where the user must make choices based on their persona
5. **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative approaches if the primary path fails

## Key Components

### 1. Job Definition Registry

A collection of predefined jobs with their associated tasks, success criteria, and decision points.

```python
class JobDefinition:
    def __init__(self, job_id, name, description, tasks, success_criteria):
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.tasks = tasks  # List of TaskDefinition objects
        self.success_criteria = success_criteria  # Dict of criteria
```

### 2. Task Decomposition Engine

Responsible for breaking down jobs into executable tasks based on the persona's characteristics.

```python
class TaskPlanner:
    def __init__(self, persona, job_definition):
        self.persona = persona
        self.job_definition = job_definition
        
    def create_execution_plan(self):
        """Generate a personalized execution plan for the job"""
        # Adjust task sequence based on persona characteristics
        # Add decision points based on persona preferences
        # Include fallback strategies based on tech proficiency
```

### 3. Task Execution Engine

Executes the planned tasks using browser automation, making decisions at choice points based on the persona.

```python
class TaskExecutor:
    def __init__(self, browser_context, execution_plan):
        self.browser = browser_context
        self.plan = execution_plan
        self.results = JobExecutionResults()
        
    def execute(self):
        """Execute all tasks in the plan"""
        for task in self.plan.tasks:
            try:
                task_result = self._execute_task(task)
                self.results.add_task_result(task_result)
                
                if task_result.is_blocking_failure():
                    self._attempt_recovery(task, task_result)
            except Exception as e:
                self.results.add_error(task, str(e))
```

### 4. State Management

Tracks the state of the job execution, including completed tasks, current context, and collected data.

```python
class JobState:
    def __init__(self, job_definition, persona):
        self.job_definition = job_definition
        self.persona = persona
        self.current_task_index = 0
        self.completed_tasks = []
        self.failed_tasks = []
        self.collected_data = {}
        self.decision_history = []
```

### 5. Browser Interaction Layer

Enhanced browser automation that simulates realistic user behavior based on persona characteristics.

```python
class PersonaBasedBrowser:
    def __init__(self, playwright_browser, persona):
        self.browser = playwright_browser
        self.persona = persona
        self.behavior_engine = BehaviorEngine(persona)
        
    def navigate(self, url):
        """Navigate with persona-specific behavior"""
        # Add realistic delays
        # Simulate attention patterns
        # Handle errors according to persona's patience
        
    def find_element(self, selector):
        """Find elements with persona-specific search patterns"""
        # Simulate visual scanning
        # Account for tech proficiency in element identification
```

## Implementation Plan

2. Develop the `TaskExecutor` to run the plans
3. Create the state management system

### Phase 3: Enhanced Browser Automation

1. Implement the persona-based browser wrapper
2. Develop realistic behavior simulation
3. Add error recovery strategies

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing

1. Integrate with existing persona generation
2. Connect with reporting system
3. Test with various website types and personas

## Sample Job Definitions

### Product Discovery Job

```yaml
job_id: product_discovery
name: "Product Discovery"
description: "Browse the website to discover products of interest"
tasks:
  - task_id: navigate_to_homepage
    name: "Navigate to Homepage"
    
  - task_id: explore_categories
    name: "Explore Product Categories"
    
  - task_id: browse_featured_products
    name: "Browse Featured Products"
    
  - task_id: examine_product_details
    name: "Examine Product Details"
    
success_criteria:
  - "At least 3 product categories explored"
  - "At least 2 product detail pages viewed"
  - "Spent minimum of 30 seconds on product pages"
```

### Purchase Completion Job

```yaml
job_id: purchase_completion
name: "Purchase Completion"
description: "Search for a product, add to cart, and complete checkout"
tasks:
  - task_id: search_for_product
    name: "Search for Product"
    
  - task_id: select_product
    name: "Select Product from Results"
    
  - task_id: add_to_cart
    name: "Add Product to Cart"

    name: "Proceed to Checkout"
    
  - task_id: fill_shipping_info
    name: "Fill Shipping Information"
    
  - task_id: select_payment_method
    name: "Select Payment Method"
    
  - task_id: complete_order
    name: "Complete Order"
    
success_criteria:
  - "Product successfully added to cart"
  - "Shipping information entered correctly"
  - "Payment method selected"
  - "Order confirmation page reached"
```

## Conclusion

The job-centric simulation approach will provide more realistic and comprehensive evaluations of e-commerce websites by focusing on complete user journeys rather than isolated actions. This will result in more meaningful insights and recommendations for website improvements.
