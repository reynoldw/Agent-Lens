# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the AgentReviewHub architecture.

## System Components

### 1. Persona Generation Module

The persona generation module creates diverse, realistic user personas with varying demographics, technical skills, and preferences. It uses OpenAI's API to generate detailed persona profiles that guide the simulation process.

### 2. Website Simulation Module

The website simulation module uses Playwright to automate browser interactions based on persona characteristics. It simulates realistic user behaviors such as navigation, search, product exploration, and checkout processes.

### 3. Review Generation Module

The review generation module creates detailed, human-like reviews from each persona's perspective based on their simulated experiences. It captures both positive and negative aspects of the website experience.

### 4. Expert Analysis Module

The expert analysis module aggregates data from all simulations and reviews to identify patterns, common issues, and improvement opportunities. It calculates scores across various dimensions and generates actionable recommendations.

### 5. Reporting Module

The reporting module creates comprehensive reports with visualizations, scores, and recommendations. It presents the data in an easy-to-understand format for stakeholders.

## Data Flow

1. User inputs a website URL and configuration parameters
2. System generates personas based on configuration
3. For each persona, the system simulates website interactions
4. Based on simulation results, the system generates reviews
5. The expert analysis module processes all data to create insights
6. The reporting module generates a comprehensive report
7. Results are presented to the user through the web interface

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright
