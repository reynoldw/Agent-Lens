## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A valid OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reynoldw/AgentReviewHub.git
   cd AgentReviewHub
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install browser automation dependencies:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. Enter a website URL and the number of personas to generate, then click "Start Evaluation"
## üîß Configuration

You can customize the evaluation process by modifying the following files:

- `config.py`: General configuration settings
- `src/persona/templates.py`: Persona generation templates and parameters
- `src/expert/analyzer.py`: Analysis parameters and scoring weights

## üåê Use Cases

- **E-commerce Optimization**: Identify and fix usability issues that impact conversion rates
- **UX Research**: Gather diverse perspectives on website usability without expensive user testing
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compare your website against competitors across multiple dimensions
- **Accessibility Testing**: Identify potential accessibility issues for users with different needs
- **Pre-launch Validation**: Test new designs or features before public release

## üîÆ Future Expansion

### Social Interactions
- **Multi-Agent Conversations**: Simulate interactions between multiple personas discussing products
- **Social Proof Simulation**: Model how social signals influence purchasing decisions
- **Community Engagement**: Evaluate community features like forums and review sections

### Memory and Adaptive Behavior
- **Long-term User Journeys**: Simulate returning users with memory of previous interactions
- **Learning Behaviors**: Model how users adapt to interfaces over time
- **Preference Evolution**: Track how user preferences change based on experiences

### Social Dynamics
- **Group Decision Making**: Simulate family or team purchasing decisions
- **Influence Networks**: Model how opinions spread through simulated social networks
- **Cultural Variations**: Evaluate how cultural differences affect user experience

### Beyond E-commerce
- **Educational Platforms**: Evaluate learning experiences and knowledge retention
- **Healthcare Interfaces**: Assess medical information accessibility and comprehension
- **Government Services**: Test civic service portals for usability across diverse populations
- **Financial Services**: Evaluate banking and investment platform experiences

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

Our immediate focus is on improving the simulation functionality:

1. **Enhanced Browser Interaction**: Developing a custom browser interaction module to replace Playwright for more nuanced control
2. **Expanded Persona Capabilities**: Adding more sophisticated behavioral models and decision-making processes
3. **Custom Persona Creation**: Allowing users to define specific personas for targeted testing
4. **A/B Testing**: Implementing comparison features for evaluating design alternatives
5. **Historical Tracking**: Adding support for tracking website improvements over time
